VoxelPhysics
============

My 3rd Year Dissertaion Project.

An attempt to use voxels to model the effects or stress and pressure on objects during collisions.

Uses Bullet Physics for the rigid body physics, and a custom system for the 'internal physics' of objects. 

Unfortunatly does not *quite* run in real time, but I plan to improve upon this system as time goes on. I will probably rebuild the application from scratch with cleaner source code at some point.

A runnable demo can be found here:

	

I apologise for the lack of documentation and support, I will be working on this over the next month or so.
